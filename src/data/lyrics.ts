(Written by Cyn Electric)

Did you really think that I would just give in
Who you think you're trying to kidd
And if you kiss me, you'll miss me
Ya missed me, ya missed me

Well you can keep being mad
I guess you wanted everything and everything I am
Well you can keep being mad
Ya missed me, ya missed me

Say more if you got it in you
Say more if you got it in, got it in you
Say more if you got it in, got it in you
If you got it in you

Look at me
Look at my little dreams
I don't see you on the dancefloor making money
I just see you in the background, aint it funny
Well look at my little dreams
Look at me, look at me
Look at my little dreams
look at me, look at me
And look at my little dreams

Oh, you thought time would defeat me
But tell me how it is to have me taking space
Without a doubt, we haven't even gotten to the part where I am living rent-free
Well you can keep being mad
I'll keep on keepin' my own
And you'll keep on keepin' tabs
But you can keep being mad
'Cause you miss me, you miss me

Am I still under your skin
Under your
Am I still under your skin`,

(Written by Cyn Electric)

Weak hands, I'll let you lead 'em in the end
We could build 'em any place to stay
Make believe the flawlessness won't shy away
Weekends, I hope they shine on like you do
Cut the rug and make 'em say your name
I can see the foolishness on my pale face
I feel a knot, make way
I can bite the bullet to gaze on your face
First place, I can write the book on keeping hearts at bay

Someday, Someday

Oh, my selfish ways
Please
I couldn't dance, but I know that you need to watch me move just the way I was meant to
Oh, my selfish ways
Please
I couldn't dance, but I know that you need to watch me move just the way I was meant to

We can't, but I'll embrace these simple words
See your rhythm make me change my pace
I can feel the craving running in my veins
Weaken, give it a little bit now and then
It's enough to make me change my ways
Pull me out of consciousness, I might be saved

We're likely on the edge of
Likely I do better
Make way, daydreams they want to play
We're likely in some danger
I'll keep myself stranger
Daydreams, daydreams they wanna play`,

(Written by Cyn Electric)

Another dark deal, on the money
Another room made to stun and gun me
I can look away
I can save the day
When I'm not afraid
I'm in disarray
I'm in disarray, oh
And when you're talking to your friends
Did you tell 'em how I made you red
How I made you red, oh
You couldn't find no receipts, said:
"You can try my bed
Make my pillow infrared" oh

Make me look a monster
But it's not what it seems
Monster it's in your eyes
Reflection, not my dreams

You think I just won't pick it up
I let you think I'm a little dumb
I can turn around
I can make a sound
If I play the clown
I'm so safe and sound
I'm so safe and sound, oh

Do you ever have regret
The way I keep my cool
And while you're keepin' your lips wet
Can never stay near the nightstand
Hide the ultraviolet
So she can keep quiet

Oh, you think you get off scott-free
It's about time I tell my story
My one and only
Mistake
Is that a lot to take
A little vicious anecdote
Although delayed
I still feel quite played
I hope you see this as redemption
I might keep sane`,
